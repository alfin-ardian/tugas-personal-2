# React Native Project with Google Maps, Redux, and React Native Paper

## Overview

This React Native project is a part of Binus University coursework.

Project Description:
This is a simple React Native project that demonstrates the integration of Google Maps,
Redux state management, and React Native Paper UI components. The project provides a
starting point for developers looking to build mobile applications that involve maps,
state management, and a consistent user interface.

## Features

- **Google Maps Integration**: Display a map with a marker on a specific location.
- **Redux State Management**: Manage application state using Redux for a scalable and predictable state container.
- **React Native Paper UI Components**: Utilize pre-built UI components from React Native Paper for a consistent and visually appealing user interface.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- React Native development environment set up

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alfin-ardian/tugas-personal-2.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Create a `.env` file at the root of your project and add your configuration variables. For example:

   ```env
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Ensure you replace `your_api_key_here` with your actual Google Maps API key.

## Usage

Run the application on an Android or iOS emulator or device:

```bash
npm start
# or
npx react-native run-android
# or
npx react-native run-ios
```

## Folder Structure

The project follows a modular structure to enhance maintainability and scalability. Key folders include:

- **src/components**: Reusable components.
- **src/screens**: Different screens of the application.
- **src/redux**: Redux-related files (actions, reducers, store).

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- Redux
- React Native Paper
- Google Maps API
